   <faq id="Aggregate Reporting">
     <question>Is there an easy way to generate the aggregate report?</question>
     <answer>
       <p>
       Unfortunately Maven's internal support for report aggregation
       is rather poor and does have a number of limitations.
      </p>
      <p>
      This may be addressed in the future by a module like
      <a href="https://maven.apache.org/archives/maven-1.x/plugins/dashboard/">dashboard</a>
      to get an aggregate report.

     <question>How do I avoid OutOfMemory errors?</question>
       <answer>
         <p>
         When running spotbugs on a project, the default heap size might not be enough
         to complete the build. For now there is no way to fork spotbugs and run with
         its own memory requirements, but the following system variable will allow you
         to do so for Maven:
         <p>
         <code>export MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx384M</code>
         </p>
         </p>
         <p>
         You can also use the <bold>fork</bold> option which will fork a new JVM.  You then use the <bold>maxHeap</bold> option to control the heap size.    <p>

    <faq id="Groovy Conflicts">
      <question>How do I avoid groovy module conflicts when using groovy along with this plugin?</question>
        <answer>
         <p>
         If using groovy with same group id (org.codehaus.groovy 3.x or before or org.apache.groovy 4.x or above),
         an error may occur if not on same version. To alleviate that, make sure groovy artifacts are defined in
         dependency management in order to force the loaded version correctly on your usage.
