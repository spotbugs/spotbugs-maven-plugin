Violation Checking

  The <<<spotbugs:check>>> goal allows you to configure your build to fail if any errors are found
  in the SpotBugs report.
  
  The following code fragment enables the check in a build during the <<<verify>>> phase.
  The check will fail if any of the filter triggers in the include file are met.
